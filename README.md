## Overview

This repository hosts a C++ Competitive Programming (CP) template designed to provide a standardized boilerplate for contests, reducing setup time and allowing you to focus solely on problem-solving ([github.com][1], [github.com][2]). The template includes fast I/O configurations, commonly used type aliases, macros for loops and container operations, debug utilities, and a structure to handle multiple test cases efficiently ([github.com][2], [github.com][3]).

## Features

* **Single-Header Inclusion**: Utilizes `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to import all standard library headers at once, mirroring practices in established CP repositories ([github.com][1], [github.com][4]).
* **Type Aliases and Macros**: Provides convenient aliases (`ll`, `vi`, `pii`, etc.) and macros (`rep`, `all`, `pb`, etc.) to shorten code and reduce boilerplate—an approach widely adopted by high-star templates on GitHub ([github.com][2], [github.com][5]).
* **Fast I/O Setup**: Configures `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(nullptr)` for improved input/output speed, which is essential for handling large data volumes in contests ([github.com][2], [bulldogjob.com][6]).
* **Debug Utilities**: Wraps debug printing in `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` guards, enabling local debugging without polluting submissions—following best practices from popular CP repositories ([github.com][4], [github.com][3]).
* **Test-Case Management**: Includes a `solve()` function template and logic in `main()` to read multiple test cases, reflecting standard patterns seen in top-tier competitive programmers’ code ([github.com][2], [github.com][5]).

## File Structure

```plaintext
.
├── CP_Template.cpp      # Main C++ template file
├── README.md            # This README document
└── LICENSE              # License information
```

* `CP_Template.cpp` contains all the boilerplate code (headers, macros, debug utilities, and `solve()`/`main()` structure) ([github.com][2], [github.com][3]).
* `README.md` provides an overview, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines, consistent with best practices for GitHub documentation ([bulldogjob.com][6], [arxiv.org][7]).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CP-Template.git
   ```

   Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username ([bulldogjob.com][6], [github.com][5]).
2. **Open in IDE**: Navigate to the cloned directory and open `CP_Template.cpp` in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor ([github.com][2], [github.com][3]).
3. **Customize if Needed**: You can modify macros, add algorithm-specific snippets, or adjust the debug utility as per personal preference. Many contributors maintain branches with extended snippets for algorithms like segment trees or DSU; feel free to integrate those ideas ([github.com][4], [github.com][5]).
4. **Compile and Run**:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 CP_Template.cpp -o cp_template
   ./cp_template < input.txt > output.txt
   ```

   The default settings target GNU C++17 with optimizations; adjust flags as needed for other compilers ([github.com][2], [bulldogjob.com][6]).

## Customization and Extensions

* **Adding Algorithm Snippets**: As you encounter new problem patterns, store snippets (such as graph algorithms, data structures, or geometry routines) either below the `solve()` function or in separate files for quick inclusion during contests ([github.com][4], [github.com][5]).
* **Macro Expansion**: Feel free to extend the macro list with utility functions (e.g., `readVector(v, n)`) or additional shorthand for container operations—this is a common practice in many CP repositories to suit individual styles ([github.com][1], [github.com][3]).
* **Debugging Enhancements**: You can integrate time profiling or assertion checks under the `#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE` block to track performance and catch issues early, a strategy employed by many seasoned competitors ([bulldogjob.com][6], [arxiv.org][7]).

## Contributing

Contributions to improve this template are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click “Fork” on the GitHub page to create your own copy ([bulldogjob.com][6], [github.com][5]).
